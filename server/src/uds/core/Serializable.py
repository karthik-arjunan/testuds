    This class represents the interface that all serializable objects must provide.

    Every single serializable class must implement marshall & unmarshall methods. Also, the class must allow
    to be initialized without parameters, so we can:
    - Initialize the object with default values
    - Read values from seralized data

        The system will use in fact 'seralize' and 'deserialize' methods, but theese are
        only suitable methods to "codify" serialized values
