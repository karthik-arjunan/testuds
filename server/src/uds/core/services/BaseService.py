class Service(Module):
    '''
    This class is in fact an interface, and represents a service, that is the
    definition of an offering for consumers (users).

    Class derived from this one declares the behavior of the service, as well
    as custom parameter that will be needed to provide final consumable elements
    to users.

    The behavior attributes must be declared always, although they have default
    values, this can change in a future and declaring all needed is a good way
    to avoid future problems. Of course, if you declare that do no do something
    (i.e. do not uses cache), you will not have to declare related attributes
    (i.e. cacheTooltip, usesCache_L2 and cacheTooltip_L2)

    As you derive from this class, if you provide __init__ in your own class,
    remember to call ALWAYS at base class __init__  as this:

       super(self.__class__, self).__init__(dbAuth, environment, values)

    This is a MUST (if you override __init__), so internal structured gets
    filled correctly, so don't forget it!.

    The preferred method of provide initialization is to provide the :py:meth:`.initialize`,
    and do not override __init__ method. This (initialize) will be invoked after
    all internal initialization, so there will be available parent, environment and storage.

    Normally objects of classes deriving from this one, will be serialized, called,
    deserialized. This means that all that you want to ensure that is kept inside
    the class must be serialized and unserialized, because there is no warrantee that
    the object will get two methods invoked without haven't been removed from memory
    and loaded again. One thing to have into account on this are Form Fields, that
    default implementation marshals and unmashals them, so if your case is that you
    only need data that is keeped at form fields, marshal and unmarshal and in fact
    not needed.
