    correspondence of which user belongs to which group.

    UDS Only knows a subset of this groups, those that the administrator has
    registered inside UDS.

    To manage the equivalence between groups from the authenticator and UDS groups,
    we provide a list of "known groups" by uds. The authenticator then makes the

    valid.

    Managed groups names are compared using case insensitive comparison.
