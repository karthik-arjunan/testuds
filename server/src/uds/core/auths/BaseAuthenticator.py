    This class represents the base interface to implement authenticators.

    An authenticator is responsible for managing user and groups of a kind
    inside UDS. As so, it must provide a number of method and mechanics to
    allow UDS to manage users and groups using that kind of authenticator.

    Some samples of authenticators are LDAP, Internal Database, SAML, CAS, ...

    As always, if you override __init__, do not forget to invoke base __init__ as this::

       super(self.__class__, self).__init__(self, dbAuth, environment, values)

    This is a MUST, so internal structured gets filled correctly, so don't forget it!.

    The preferred method of doing initialization is to provide the :py:meth:`.initialize`,
    and do not override __init__ method. This (initialize) will be invoked after
    all internal initialization.

    There are basically two kind of authenticators, that are "Externals" and
    "Internals".

    Internal authenticators are those where and administrator has created manually
    the user at admin interface. The users are not created from an external source,
    so if an user do not exist at UDS database, it will not be valid.
    In other words, if you have an authenticator where you must create users,
    you can modify them, you must assign passwords manually, and group membership
    also must be assigned manually, the authenticator is not an externalSource.

    As you can notice, almost avery authenticator except internal db will be
    external source, so, by default, attribute that indicates that is an external
    source is set to True.


    In fact, internal source authenticator is intended to allow UDS to identify
    if the users come from internal DB (just the case of local authenticator),
    or the users come from other sources. Also, this allos UDS to know when to
    "update" group membership information for an user whenever it logs in.

    External authenticator are in fact all authenticators except local database,
    so we have defined isExternalSource as True by default, that will be most
    cases.

    :note: All attributes that are "_" here means that they will be
           translated when provided to administration interface, so remember
           to mark them in your own authenticators as "_" using
           ugettext_noop. We have aliased it here to "_" so it's
           easier to understand.
