    Basic service, the first part (variables) include the description of the service.
    
    Remember to fill all variables needed, but at least you must define:
        * typeName
        * typeType
        * typeDescription
        * iconFile (defaults to service.png)
        * publicationType, type of publication in case it needs publication. 
          If this is not provided, core will assume that the service do not 
          needs publishing.
        * deployedType, type of deployed user service. Do not forget this!!!
        
    The rest of them can be ommited, but its recommended that you fill all
    declarations shown in this sample (that in fact, are all)
    
    This description informs the core what this service really provides,
    and how this is done. Look at description of class variables for more
    information.
